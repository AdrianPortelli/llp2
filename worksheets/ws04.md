# WS04: Multiple Versions

## Calculator
Create a file called ```calc.c``` and in it implement a calculator that takes 3 command line arguments as shown below and outputs the result of the operation:
```
calc num symbol num
```
Your calculator should be able to perform addition, subtraction multiplication and division. Example:
```
$./calc 99 + 6
99 + 6 = 105
$./calc 99 – 6
99 - 6 = 93
```
*Hint: passing * (asterisk) as a command line argument (e.g.: calc 6 * 6) results in Linux
expanding it to all the files in the current working directory. You need to find a way around this.*

## Multiple versions
Use a single makefile (with multiple targets) and ```#ifdef``` to produce to produce two versions of the calculator from the same ```calc.c```
1. **calc**: A full version of the program
2. **calc_demo**: A demo version that can only do additions

Demo example usage:
```
$./calc_demo 99 + 6
99 + 6 = 105
$./calc_demo 99 – 6
Error: Demo only supports additions
```

## Parameter validation
If some missing or invalid arguments are passed, it should show a help message. Example:
```
$./calc 99 m 6
Error: invalid operator
$./calc 99 - six
Error: invalid number
$./calc 99 –
Error: missing number
$./calc - 6
Error: missing number
$./calc 99 6
Error: missing operator
```
