# WS12: Static and Dynamic Libraries (optional)
Static and dynamic linking collect and combine multiple object files in a single executable.  
Linking, performed by programs called linkers, can be performed at:
* **compile time**: the source code is translated into machine code (last step in compilation)
* **load/run time**: when the program is loaded into memory and executed by the loader

## Linking
Instead of a large application in a single source file, it is better to have smaller, more manageable, sources which may be compiled separately.

Static linking:
* All library routines used are copied in the executable.
* More space used on the disk and in memory.
* Faster and more portable (no dependencies).

Dynamic linking:
* Shareable library name is placed in the executable image and actual linking takes place at run time
* Sharing a single shareable library among multiple programs.
* Executables are smaller.

Missing function definitions:
* During compilation: compiler assumes that the function is defined in another file, and treats it as an external reference. The compiler does not look at more than one file at a time.
* During linking: linker may look at multiple files and seeks references for the modules that were not mentioned, complaining when they are not found.

## Static linking
The linker combines library routines with the program code to resolve external references, and to generate an executable image suitable for loading into memory. In the example we will be using the following files: 
* ```add.c``` - Add module code 
* ```add.h``` - Prototype of add module 
* ```addDemo.c``` - Used to demonstrate the linking process

**Step1**: Create a header file ```add.h``` with the ```add()``` function signature:
```c
int add(int, int);
```

**Step2**: Create a source file ```addDemo.c``` with the following code: 
```c
#include <add.h> 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
  int x= 10, y = 20;
  printf("\n%d + %d = %d", x, y, add(x, y));
  return 0;
}
```
**Step3**: Create a file named add.c with the code of add module: 
```c
int add(int quant1, int quant2) {
  return(quant1 + quant2);
}
```
**Step4**: Build the executable as follows: 
```$ gcc -I . -c addDemo.c 
$ ls 
add.c add.h addDemo.c addDemo.o 
```
The -I option tells GCC to search for header files in the directory which is specified after it. Here, GCC is asked to look for header files in the current directory along with the include directory.
*Note: InUnix/Linuxsystems the . is interpreted as current directory.*

**Step5**: compile ```add.c``` 
```
$ gcc -c add.c 
$ ls 
add.c add.h add.o addDemo.c addDemo.o 
```

**Step6**: Generate the executable by linking ```add.o```, and ```addDemo.o``` to generate executable object file: 
```
$ gcc -o addDemo add.o addDemo.o 
$ ls 
add.c add.h add.o addDemo.c addDemo addDemo.o 
```
*Note: the linker could also be directly be invoked using the ld command*

```
