# WS12: Static and Dynamic Libraries (optional)
Static and dynamic linking collect and combine multiple object files in a single executable.  
Linking, performed by programs called linkers, can be performed at:
* **compile time**: the source code is translated into machine code (last step in compilation)
* **load/run time**: when the program is loaded into memory and executed by the loader

## Linking
Instead of a large application in a single source file, it is better to have smaller, more manageable, sources which may be compiled separately.

Static linking:
* All library routines used are copied in the executable.
* More space used on the disk and in memory.
* Faster and more portable (no dependencies).

Dynamic linking:
* Shareable library name is placed in the executable image and actual linking takes place at run time
* Sharing a single shareable library among multiple programs.
* Executables are smaller.

Missing function definitions:
* During compilation: compiler assumes that the function is defined in another file, and treats it as an external reference. The compiler does not look at more than one file at a time.
* During linking: linker may look at multiple files and seeks references for the modules that were not mentioned, complaining when they are not found.
